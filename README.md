# My-Website
Coding a business website from scratch using HTML/CSS<br>
The design is going to be basic and minimal as I will not be utilizing any pre-built templates or web-host design functionality (except probably for a contact form). This project is intended to provide an example of HTML/CSS features and good design principles. <br>
9/8/19: Moving in a new direction with the website, focusing on art and coding and not strictly web development. Will be updating layout and wording.
