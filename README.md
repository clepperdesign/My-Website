# My-Website
Coding a business website from scratch using HTML/CSS<br>
The design is going to be basic and minimal as I will not be utilizing any pre-built templates or web-host design functionality. This project is intended to provide an example of HTML/CSS features and good design principles. <br>
<br>6/5/19- Need to learn PHP to code my own form. Started work on Contact page; still mastering PHP basics. Page appears to work when run in Apache server on own computer, breaks a little when run in browser alone, which I believe is to be expected. I could just use a pre-built form plugin, but I want to properly understand how forms work and create my own.<br>
6/4/19- Have completed homepage, work started on About page. Website not responsive enough; will update once pages completed.<br>
6/1/19- Simplified header and added an intro section. Nav bar to come.<br>
5/30/19- Uploaded initial homepage files. Currently only have a basic header with logo. Much more to come!
