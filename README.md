# My-Website
Coding a business website from scratch using HTML/CSS<br>
The design is going to be basic and minimal as I will not be utilizing any pre-built templates or web-host design functionality. This project is intended to provide an example of HTML/CSS features and good design principles. <br>
6/1/19- Simplified header and added an intro section. Nav bar to come.
5/30/19- Uploaded initial homepage files. Currently only have a basic header with logo. Much more to come!
