# My-Website
Coding a business website from scratch using HTML/CSS<br>
The design is going to be basic and minimal as I will not be utilizing any pre-built templates or web-host design functionality (except probably for a contact form). This project is intended to provide an example of HTML/CSS features and good design principles. <br>
9/8/19: Moving in a new direction with the website, focusing on art and coding and not strictly web development. Will be updating layout and wording. Added a footer, improved some links to optimize accessibility. <br>
9/9/19: Added Portfolio directory page, as well as Art and Programming detail pages. <br>
9/17/19: Added more detail to Programming and Art detail pages, made the detail page CSS more reusable.<br>
9/18/19: Added detail pages to the art portfolio with a slideshow. The small bit of JavaScript was taken from W3 Schools. Images on Crane and Creatures page were cropped to all be the same size for consistent display.
